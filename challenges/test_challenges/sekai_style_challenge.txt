# Cryptographic Challenge - Graph Recovery Attack

You are given an encrypted graph representation and need to recover the original query structure.

## Challenge Description

This challenge implements a variation of the Query Recovery attack against graph encryption schemes, similar to the method described in cryptographic research papers.

## Given Information

```
Encrypted edges: [(h1, h2), (h2, h3), (h1, h4), (h4, h5)]
Hash tokens: 
- a3b2c1d4e5f6789abcdef...
- b4c5d6e7f8901234567890...
- c6d7e8f90123456789abcd...

Node mappings are encrypted using SHA256.
```

## Hints

1. This is related to shortest path queries in encrypted graphs
2. You need to implement path name computation
3. The attack works by analyzing structural patterns
4. NetworkX library might be useful for graph operations

## Goal

Recover the original graph structure and find the flag embedded in the node relationships.
